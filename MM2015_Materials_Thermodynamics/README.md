## Introduction to Materials thermodynamics [MM2015].

The notebook contain calculation of a peritectic phase diagram from gibbs energy functions using the common tangent method. The regular solution model is assumed. The evolution of the diagram with temperature is captured into an animation available as `PERITECTIC_PHASE_DIAGRAM.gif`. 

The notebook `SomeProblems` contain 2 simple thermodynamic numerical problems.
